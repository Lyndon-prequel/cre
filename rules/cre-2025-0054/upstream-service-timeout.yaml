    title: NGINX upstream connection timeout
    category: proxy-timeout-problem
    author: Prequel
    description: |
      NGINX reports an upstream timeout error when it cannot establish or maintain a connection to backend services within the configured timeout threshold. 
      This occurs when backend services are unresponsive, overloaded, or when the timeout values are set too low for normal operation conditions.
      The error indicates that NGINX attempted to proxy a request to an upstream server, but the connection or read operation timed out before completion.
    cause: |
      - Overloaded backend services unable to process requests in time
      - Network latency between NGINX and backend services
      - Backend service processing requests too slowly
      - Insufficient timeout settings in NGINX configuration
      - Backend service connection pool exhaustion
      - Resource constraints on backend servers (CPU, memory, disk I/O)
      - Application code inefficiencies in backend services

    mitigation: |
      - Review backend service performance and identify bottlenecks
      - Adjust NGINX timeout settings to accommodate realistic response times:
        - Increase `proxy_read_timeout` if backends need more time to generate responses
        - Adjust `proxy_connect_timeout` for connection establishment issues
        - Consider `proxy_send_timeout` for slow uploads
      - Scale backend services horizontally to handle increased load
      - Implement health checks to remove unhealthy backends from rotation
      - Add caching for frequently requested content to reduce backend load
      - Optimize backend application code and database queries
      - Consider implementing circuit breakers to fail fast rather than waiting for timeouts
      - Monitor backend response times and set alerts for increasing latency

    impact: |
      - Failed requests and HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout errors returned to clients
      - Degraded user experience due to slow or failed responses
      - Increased error rates in monitoring systems
      - Potential cascading failures if retry mechanisms overwhelm already struggling backends
      - Loss of business transactions if timeout affects critical user flows
      - Reduced application reliability and availability metrics
