      title: RabbitMQ Mnesia overloaded
      category: message-queue-problem
      author: Prequel
      description: |
        The underlying Erlang process, Mnesia, is overloaded (`** WARNING ** Mnesia is overloaded`). 
      cause: |
        One way this can happen is when a RabbitMQ cluster is processing a large number of persistent mirrored queues at boot. There are so many queues that the underlying Erlang process, Mnesia, reports that it is overloaded while recovering these queues. 
      impact: |
        RabbitMQ is unable to process any new messages, which can lead to outages in consumers and producers.

      mitigation: |
        - Increase the size of the cluster
        - Increase the Kubernetes CPU limits for the RabbitMQ brokers
        - Consider adjusting mirroring policies to limit the number of mirrored queues
        - Remove high-availability policies from queues where it is not needed
        - Consider using [lazy queues](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/lazy-queues) to avoid incurring the costs of writing data to disk
